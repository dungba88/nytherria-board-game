When the Stone of Life shattered, and the stars wept over the sundered earth, **Palmyria** did not fall. Amid the ruin and silence, one voice rose — not in rage, but in duty.

**The King** does not reign for glory. He is the last flame of a dying lineage, a sentinel crowned not in pride, but burden. He holds fast within the **White Citadel of Palmyria**, a shining bastion of order and memory. His sacred weapon, the **Sword of Light**, is drawn not in conquest, but in defense — of a world on the edge of forgetting itself.

Though his body wearies, his presence commands. He is not merely ruler — he is *remembrance given form*.

### 🃏 Tarot Meaning

- **Upright** — *Leadership, duty, legacy, righteous authority*  
  You are being called to act from a place of higher purpose. Protect, guide, and make hard decisions for the good of others — not yourself.

- **Reversed** — *Tyranny, pride, rigidity, corrupted power*  
  Authority without compassion becomes cruelty. You may be holding onto control out of fear. Let go, or become what you once opposed.
