Lurking deep within the **Temple of the Astrals**, past crumbling stairs and forgotten rites, dwells a presence ancient and unknowable. **The Abyssal Maw** does not move. It does not hunt. It simply waits — for those bold or foolish enough to seek the Magical Stones within the sacred halls.

Legends whisper that it was born in the wake of the **Great Shattering** — a creature formed from the very trauma of the explosion, where divine energy collapsed into primal hunger. Whether it is a guardian or a curse is no longer clear.

Its lair, known as the **Deep Sanctum**, is a place where echoes do not return, and even light seems to recoil. To enter the Temple is to enter its jaws. Few return.

What you think is power may in truth be feeding something far greater — and far more dangerous.
