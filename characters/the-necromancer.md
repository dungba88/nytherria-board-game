Unlike his brethren, **The Necromancer** shuns blades and staffs. His power lies in **raw dominion over death itself** — a force bent to his will through sheer mastery, not tools. Once a healer in the age before the **Great Shattering**, he turned to forbidden arts in search of a way to defy mortality. What he found instead was a way to **command it**.

His presence corrodes the veil between life and death. Bones stir at his passing. The long-forgotten rise and whisper their allegiance. Though pale and seemingly withered, his voice can rattle the earth — and in the silence that follows, the dead walk.

He seeks not conquest, but **completion**. Every corpse is an unfinished sentence. And he intends to write the final word.
