# ✦ Rules: *Nytherria – War for the Magical Stones* ✦

---

## ❖ Objective

Compete to be the first player to **collect the required number of magical stones** in the ancient Temple of the Astrals, then **achieve final victory by having the highest score** when the game ends. Gathering stones is only the beginning — your strategy, timing, and card play determine who truly wins.

---

## ❖ Components

- **62 Character Cards (Base Game)**
- **40 Neutral Cards**
  - 12 Magical Stones (6 Light, 6 Dark)
  - 20 Trap Cards
  - 8 Event Cards
- **Graveyard** (discard pile from character cards, can be recycled)
- **Neutral Graveyard** (discard pile from neutral cards, cannot be recycled)
- **Void** (permanently removed cards)
- **Deck zones**: Main Deck, Neutral Deck, Player Hands

---

## ❖ Setup

1. Shuffle the **main deck** (character cards).
2. Shuffle the **neutral deck** (stones, traps, events).
3. Each player draws **5 cards** from the main deck. Cards are factioned but players cannot choose, instead they play with whichever cards dealt to them.
4. Decide starting player randomly. Play proceeds clockwise.

---

## ❖ Turn Structure

Each player's turn consists of the following phases:

### 1. **Draw phase**
- Draw **1 card** from the main deck, unless a card ability stated otherwise.

### 2. **Main Phase**
- Choose **1 card** from your hand and play it face-up.
- Resolve its ability immediately.
- Send the card to the **graveyard** after resolving (unless otherwise stated).

### 3. **Counter phase**
- An opponent can choose to play an appropriate **Quickplay** card to counter your played card.
- Resolve its ability immediately.
- Send the card to the **graveyard** after resolving (unless otherwise stated).

### 4. **End Turn**
- Starting from the current player, discard down to 5 cards if over hand limit, or draw more if below.
- Checklist: All players must have exactly 5 cards when the turn ends.
- The next player begins their turn.

Important: After any action during the game that return cards to the neutral or main deck, shuffle the neutral/main deck respectively.

---

## ❖ End Game

- A player who collects **the required number of magical stones** triggers the **endgame**.
  - For 2-3 players: 5 stones
  - For 4 players: 4 stones
- If all stones have been collected, it also triggers the endgame. There are a total of 12 stones.
- Then, calculate **total score** to determine the winner.

### 🧮 Scoring Rules:
- Each **Magical Stone**: 2 points
- Bonus points if all collected **Magical Stone** are the same attribute (Light/Dark): 2 points
- Each **The Solider/The Ravager** remaining in hand: 1 point
- Other cards remaining in hand: 2 points

## ❖ Card Types

### 🎴 Character Cards
- **Factioned**: Certain character abilities are limited by their factions. The base game consists of Light and Dark factions.
- **Faction leader**: Each faction has a powerful card, but they are not resurrectable once played.
- **Quickplay cards**: Can be played during another player’s turn **in response** to a specific action.
- Each character has a unique ability — e.g., stealing, destroying, reviving, or countering. The most ubiquitous cards are The Soldier/The Ravager which make the backbone of the Light/Dark army respectively.
- Character cards are sent to the graveyard after use unless stated otherwise.

See [characters.md](characters.md) for the detailed explanation of each character card.

## ❖ Neutral Cards

### ❖ Magical Stones

- 2 types of stones: Light Stone and Dark Stone.
- Stored in front of the player once claimed.
- Only The Soldier and The Ravager can claim it. **The Solider** may only claim **Light Stones**, and **The Ravager** may only claim **Dark Stones**.
- Characters like **The Sorceress** and **The Hex** can manipulate opponent's stones (e.g. steal or return).

### ❖ Traps

- When encountering traps in the neutral deck, simply move the trap to the neutral graveyard.

### ❖ Events

- When encountering Event cards in the neutral deck, do as the card instructs.

---

## ❖ Graveyard and Void

- **Graveyard**: All resolved cards go here unless banished.
- **Void**: Cards here are permanently removed from play, and cannot be recycled.

---

## ❖ Additional Rules

- **Deck Exhaustion**: If the main deck runs out, shuffle the graveyard into a new main deck.
- **Counter Rules**: Quickplay cards must be played immediately in response or their effect is lost. In case multiple players can play quickplay cards, the person closest (in clockwise) to the current player will be given priority. Note that for cards targeting a specific player, only that player can counter with quickplay cards.
