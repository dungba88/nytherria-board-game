Long after the **Great Shattering**, when kingdoms crumbled and the skies wept ash, one figure rose from the forgotten dead — not born of flesh, but of memory, sorrow, and the will to punish. **The Reaper** is not a man. He is an echo.

No one knows who he once was. Some claim he was a fallen knight of Palmyria who lost everything. Others say he is a curse given form — vengeance for the unburied dead of the last war. Cloaked in tattered black, he walks the scorched battlefields and grave-choked wastes of **the Land of the Dead**, dragging behind him a scythe that hums with unspent screams.

To meet his gaze is to feel the weight of every death you've denied, every fate you've postponed. And when he raises his blade, no spell, oath, or plea can save you.

You cannot outrun what is already walking behind you.
